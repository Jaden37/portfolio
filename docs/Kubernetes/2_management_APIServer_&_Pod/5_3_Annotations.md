* Used to add additional information about your cluster resources
* Mostly used by people or tooling to make decisions
* Build, release, and image information exposed in easily accessible areas
* Saves you from having to write integrations to retrieve data from external data sources
* Non-hierarchical, key/value pair
* Can’t be used to query/select Pods or other resources
* Data is used for “other” purposes
* Keys can be up to 63 characters
* Values can be up to 256KB

kubectl annotate pod nginx-pod owner=Anthony
kubectl annotate pod nginx-pod owner=NotAnthony --overwrite
```
